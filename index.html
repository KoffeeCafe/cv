       only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to (although each record is encrypted).
       <br>
      All Bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power via a process known as "mining."</em>

    <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</li>
      <li>Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored with the use of a decentralized ledger system, known as a blockchain.</li>
      <li>Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has gone through several cycles of boom and bust over its relatively short lifespan.</li>
      <li>As the earliest virtual currency to meet widespread popularity and success, Bitcoin has inspired a host of other cryptocurrencies in its wake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      But if an attack were to happen, Bitcoin miners—the people who take part in the Bitcoin network with their computers—would likely split off to a new blockchain,
      making the effort the bad actor put forth to achieve the attack a waste.
